    "Another object type that is closely related to iterators is the **generator**. Generators can be counted as one of the strengths of Python relative to other programming languages that don't have this feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators are a way of defining a procedure to get the next number in a sequence. They can remember where they were left off in a sequence, and generate the next number each time they are called. To understand them let's consider the *infinite* sequence of square numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{1,\\ 4,\\ 9,\\ 16,\\ 25,\\ ...,\\ n^2,\\ ...}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using functions and lists, we cannot produce an infinite sequence. At best we can write a function that takes an argument $N$ as an input and returns a list of square numbers up to $N^2$. This is not ideal! We want an object that can remember what the last square number it calculated was, and then generate the next square number the next time we call it. In this way, we have no limitation on the number of times we call this sequence producer (and we don't take up much memory). The beloved object that can manage to do this for us is **generator**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a generator, we write something that looks a little like a function, but instead of the `return` keyword we use `yield` to give a result from the generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that each time a function reaches `return` statement, it returns its output and the compiler completely forgets what values were stored inside the function variables. Next time we call the function, it starts from the beginning and does not remember anything from the last time it was called. A generator is very different though:\n",
    "- The first time it is called (using `next()`), it starts from the beginning and executes commands until it reaches the first `yield` statement. At this point, it stops and yields the value.\n",
    "- The second time it is called, it starts from the previous `yield` statement and continues executing commands until it reaches the next `yield` statement. Then it stops again and yields the new value.\n",
    "- This procedure goes on each time we call the generator.\n",
